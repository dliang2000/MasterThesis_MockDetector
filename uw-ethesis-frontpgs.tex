\begin{center}\textbf{Statement of Contributions}\end{center}

This thesis consists of all chapters written for conference research paper submission (later rejected), with minor word changes and styling updates.

Qian Liang was the sole author for Chapters~\ref{chap:background},~\ref{chap:motivation},~\ref{chap:evaluation}, which were written under the supervision of Dr. Patrick Lam. Qian was responsible for developing the imperative Soot implementation for mock analysis, carrying out data collection and analysis from both imperative Soot and declarative Doop's implementations.

Qian Liang and Dr. Patrick Lam were the co-authors for Chapters~\ref{chap:introduction},~\ref{chap:technique},~\ref{chap:related} and~\ref{chap:discussion}.

\begin{center}\textbf{Acknowledgements}\end{center}

I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Patrick Lam, for his guidance in Soot implementation, and data analysis suggestions for Doop's base analyses. I sincerely appreciate the time, effort and patience he has put in throughout my master's program, and specifically for the thesis.

I would also like to thank Professor Gregor Richards for reading my thesis and providing invaluable suggestions and feedback on background chapter, high level description section and many other areas, and Professor Derek Rayside for providing his great insight regarding the content goes into background work.

I would also like to thank the Doop authors for responding to our questions surrounding Doop implementations and the performance of basic-only base analysis in a timely and helpful fashion.
